1) Download and install Python 2.7.3 (last 2.x package and x86!)

Website:
http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/

Package to download and install:
Windows x86 MSI Installer (2.7.3)
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi

Installation step-by-step:
- Install for all users
- Install it to some directory (I choose 'D:\Python27')
- Install it with all the features
- Next, next, finish, done

Manual step:
- Computer, right-click, Properties -> Choose 'Advanced system settings' -> Advanced tab -> Environmental variables
- Add 'd:\Python27\Scripts\' (or where ever you installed python) to the end of the PATH variable from system variables (with a ';' separator).

2) Install the compiler (mingw) and msys

Website:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw

Download link:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download

Installation step-by-step:
- Choose 'Download latest repository catalogues'
- Choose 'D:\MinGW' for installation path
- Check 'C++' and 'MSYS Basic System' from the options
This will create a command prompt window and catalogue and download/install a lot(!) of packages, just let it run and grab a coffee.

Manual step:
- Now register both bin folders in the PATH variable, so go to Computer, right-click, Properties -> Choose 'Advanced system settings' -> Advanced tab -> Environmental variables and add 'd:\MinGW\bin\' and 'd:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\' both

to the PATH variable (both with a ';' separator).

3) Install GIT

Website:
http://msysgit.github.com/

Package to download and install:
Git-1.8.1.2-preview20130201.exe
https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/detail?name=Git-1.8.1.2-preview20130201.exe&can=2&q=full+installer+official+git

Installation step-by-step:
- Installed it to 'D:\Git' with other options left as per default.

4) Get the sources

Installation step-by-step:
- Open up a NEW command prompt (also fine without 'as administrator') in e.g. root of D drive.
- Type 'D:\Git\bin\git.exe clone https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest.git', which will create 'D:\fishtest' and all python sources and other tools for testing.

5) Modify your TEMP folder (if needed)

In order not to download the sources and build to your C: drive, create a D:\Temp folder and route the temp files there:
- Go to Computer, right-click, Properties -> Choose 'Advanced system settings' -> Advanced tab -> Environmental variables and modify the current users (!) TEMP and TMP folders to 'd:\Temp'.

6) User/pass

Get a username/password pair from Marco/Gary :)

7) Running the worker process

Open a command prompt in 'd:\fishtest\worker\' and type:
'd:\Python27\python.exe worker.py --concurrency <cores> <username> <password>'
[Option concurrency refers to the number of available cores in your system (not including Hyperthreaded cores!), leaving one core for the OS. For example, on my 4 core machine, I use --concurrency 3.]

8) Let it run :)
