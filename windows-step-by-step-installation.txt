1) Download and install Python 2.7.3 (last 2.x package and x86!)

Website:
http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/

Package to download and install:
Windows x86 MSI Installer (2.7.3)
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi

Installation step-by-step:
- Install for all users
- Install it to some directory (I choose 'D:\Python27')
- Install it with all the features
- Next, next, finish, done

2) Get the sources

Download https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/archive/master.zip, and unzip it to a new directory.
For example, 'd:\fishtest'.

3) User/pass

Get a username/password pair from Marco/Gary :)

4) Running the worker process

Open a command prompt in 'd:\fishtest\worker\' and type:
'd:\Python27\python.exe worker.py --concurrency <cores> <username> <password>'
[Option concurrency refers to the number of available cores in your system (not including Hyperthreaded cores!), leaving one core for the OS. For example, on my 4 core machine, I use --concurrency 3.]

5) Let it run :)
